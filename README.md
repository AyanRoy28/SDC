# Spam Email Classifier

----

We wanted to be able to classify if emails are spam or not spam by training on the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?resource=download) from Kaggle. 

In addition to solving the above problem, we wanted to be able to find out which specific words inside the email contribute more to finding out if emails are spam-related or not.

We used classification algorithms to identify if emails in the given dataset are spam or not, and clustering algorithms for text analysis on the dataset of emails.
